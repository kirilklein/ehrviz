    Compute continuous treatment segments for each patient in a vectorized manner.

    A continuous treatment segment is defined as successive treatment events where
    the gap between events is less than interruption_days. When a gap is at least

    Parameters:
      df (pd.DataFrame): DataFrame with treatment event data.
